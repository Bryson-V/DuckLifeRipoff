DuckLife Ripoff 
=======================

 Overview:
 --------

This project consists of 2-3 mini-games, mimicking those found in Duck Life 4.  Each game will be 2D and consist of a player achieving a high score by living as long as possible, gaining  more points based on the number of obstacles cleared.  The game does not include a victory scene, as it revolves around how long the player lives.  A score is constantly counting on the top right corner, adding constantly due to time and not progress.  When the user loses in the game, the user is prompted with a menu, giving them their total score and number of obstacles passed.  This menu also allows the user to return to the menu screen where they can play a new game.  The main homepage contains an option for the player to choose which game they want to play.





Final 2-Week Sprint Goals 
--------

Instruction screen:
- The menu screen will have a button labeled “Instructions” or “How to play”
- A UI panel will pop up showing the controls and ideas of each game, divided into three 
  different subsections

UX etc:
- The player experience will be improved by adding background music and sound effects to the last two games (Dodging/Jumping)
- The jump for the player in the Jumping game will be modified to have increased gravity upon releasing a jump key to improve player experience
- The initial jump will be quicker, allowing the user to jump later than before without dying.
