DuckLife Ripoff

Overview:
This project consists of 2-3 mini-games, mimicking those found in Duck Life 4.  Each game will be 2D and consist of a player achieving a high score by living as long as possible.  The game does not include a victory scene, as it revolves around how long the player lives.  A score is constantly counting on the top right corner, adding constantly due to time and not progress.  The main homepage contains an option for the user to choose which game they would like to play
